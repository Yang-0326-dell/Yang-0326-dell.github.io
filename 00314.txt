KHLESTAKOV. What, no salmon, no fish, no cutlets?



SERVANT. Only for the better kind of folk.



KHLESTAKOV. You're a fool.



SERVANT. Yes, sir.



KHLESTAKOV. You measly suckling pig. Why can they eat and I not? Why the

devil can't I eat, too? Am I not a guest the same as they?



SERVANT. No, not the same. That's plain.



KHLESTAKOV. How so?



SERVANT. That's easy. THEY pay, that's it.



KHLESTAKOV. I'm not going to argue with you, simpleton! [Ladles out

the soup and begins to eat.] What, you call that soup? Simply hot water

poured into a cup. No taste to it at all. It only stinks. I don't want

it. Bring me some other soup.



SERVANT. All right. I'll take it away. The boss said if you didn't want

it, you needn't take it.



KHLESTAKOV [putting his hand over the dishes]. Well, well, leave it

alone, you fool. You may be used to treat other people this way, but

I'm not that sort. I advise you not to try it on me. My God! What soup!

[Goes on eating.] I don't think anybody in the world tasted such soup.

Feathers floating on the top instead of butter. [Cuts the piece of

chicken in the soup.] Oh, oh, oh! What a bird!--Give me the roast beef.

There's a little soup left, Osip. Take it. [Cuts the meat.] What sort of

roast beef is this? This isn't roast beef.



SERVANT. What else is it?



KHLESTAKOV. The devil knows, but it isn't roast beef. It's roast iron,

not roast beef. [Eats.] Scoundrels! Crooks! The stuff they give you to

eat! It makes your jaws ache to chew one piece of it. [Picks his teeth

with his fingers.] Villains! It's as tough as the bark of a tree. I

can't pull it out no matter how hard I try. Such meat is enough to ruin

one's teeth. Crooks! [Wipes his mouth with the napkin.] Is there nothing

else?



SERVANT. No.



KHLESTAKOV. Scoundrels! Blackguards! They might have given some decent

pastry, or something, the lazy good-for-nothings! Fleecing their guests!

That's all they're good for.



[The Servant takes the dishes and carries them out accompanied by Osip.]







SCENE VII





Khlestakov alone.



KHLESTAKOV. It's just as if I had eaten nothing at all, upon my word. It

has only whetted my appetite. If I only had some change to send to the

market and buy some bread.



OSIP [entering]. The Governor has come, I don't know what for. He's

inquiring about you.



KHLESTAKOV [in alarm]. There now! That inn-keeper has gone and made a

complaint against me. Suppose he really claps me into jail? Well! If he

does it in a gentlemanly way, I may--No, no, I won't. The officers and

the people are all out on the street and I set the fashion for them and

the merchant's daughter and I flirted. No, I won't. And pray, who is he?

How dare he, actually? What does he take me for? A tradesman? I'll tell

him straight out, "How dare you? How--"



[The door knob turns and Khlestakov goes pale and shrinks back.]







SCENE VIII





Khlestakov, the Governor, and Dobchinsky.



The Governor advances a few steps and stops. They stare at each other a

few moments wide-eyed and frightened.



GOVERNOR [recovering himself a little and saluting military fashion]. I

have come to present my compliments, sir.



KHLESTAKOV [bows]. How do you do, sir?



GOVERNOR. Excuse my intruding.



KHLESTAKOV. Pray don't mention it.



GOVERNOR. It's my duty as chief magistrate of this town to see that

visitors and persons of rank should suffer no inconveniences.
