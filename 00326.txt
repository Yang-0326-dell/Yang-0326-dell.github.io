

BOBCHINSKY'S VOICE. Oh, Piotr Ivanovich, you stepped on my foot.



ARTEMY. Look out, gentlemen, look out. Give me a chance to atone for my

sins. You are squeezing me to death.



Exclamations of "Oh! Oh!" Finally they all push through the door, and

the stage is left empty.







SCENE II





Enter Khlestakov, looking sleepy.



KHLESTAKOV [alone]. I seem to have had a fine snooze. Where did they get

those mattresses and feather beds from? I even perspired. After the meal

yesterday they must have slipped something into me that knocked me out.

I still feel a pounding in my head. I see I can have a good time here.

I like hospitality, and I must say I like it all the more if people

entertain me out of a pure heart and not from interested motives. The

Governor's daughter is not a bad one at all, and the mother is also a

woman you can still--I don't know, but I do like this sort of life.







SCENE III





Khlestakov and the Judge.



JUDGE [comes in and stops. Talking to himself]. Oh, God, bring me safely

out of this! How my knees are knocking together! [Drawing himself up

and holding the sword in his hand. Aloud.] I have the honor to

present myself--Judge of the District Court here, College Assessor

Liapkin-Tiapkin.



KHLESTAKOV. Please be seated. So you are the Judge here?



JUDGE. I was elected by the nobility in 1816 and I have served ever

since.



KHLESTAKOV. Does it pay to be a judge?



JUDGE. After serving three terms I was decorated with the Vladimir of

the third class with the approval of the government. [Aside.] I have the

money in my hand and my hand is on fire.



KHLESTAKOV. I like the Vladimir. Anna of the third class is not so nice.



JUDGE [slightly extending his balled fist. Aside]. Good God! I don't

know where I'm sitting. I feel as though I were on burning coals.



KHLESTAKOV. What have you got in your hand there?



AMMOS [getting all mixed up and dropping the bills on the floor].

Nothing.



KHLESTAKOV. How so, nothing? I see money has dropped out of it.



AMMOS [shaking all over]. Oh no, oh no, not at all! [Aside.] Oh, Lord!

Now I'm under arrest and they've brought a wagon to take me.



KHLESTAKOV. Yes, it IS money. [Picking it up.]



AMMOS [aside]. It's all over with me. I'm lost! I'm lost!



KHLESTAKOV. I tell you what--lend it to me.



AMMOS [eagerly]. Why, of course, of course--with the greatest pleasure.

[Aside.] Bolder! Bolder! Holy Virgin, stand by me!



KHLESTAKOV. I've run out of cash on the road, what with one thing and

another, you know. I'll let you have it back as soon as I get to the

village.



AMMOS. Please don't mention it! It is a great honor to have you take it.

I'll try to deserve it--by putting forth the best of my feeble powers,

by my zeal and ardor for the government. [Rises from the chair and draws

himself up straight with his hands hanging at his sides.] I will not

venture to disturb you longer with my presence. You don't care to give

any orders?



KHLESTAKOV. What orders?



JUDGE. I mean, would you like to give orders for the district court

here?



KHLESTAKOV. What for? I have nothing to do with the court now. No,

nothing. Thank you very much.



AMMOS [bowing and leaving. Aside.]. Now the town is ours.



KHLESTAKOV. The Judge is a fine fellow.
