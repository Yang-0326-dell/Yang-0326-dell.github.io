KHLESTAKOV. Yes, yes, what are their names?



ARTEMY. Nikolay, Ivan, Yelizaveta, Marya and Perepetuya.



KHLESTAKOV. Good.



ARTEMY. I don't venture to disturb you any longer with my presence

and rob you of your time dedicated to the performance of your sacred

duties---[Bows and makes to go.]



KHLESTAKOV [escorting him]. Not at all. What you told me is all very

funny. Call again, please. I like that sort of thing very much. [Turns

back and reopens the door, calling.] I say, there! What is your----I

keep forgetting. What is your first name and your patronymic?



ARTEMY. Artemy Filippovich.



KHLESTAKOV. Do me a favor, Artemy Filippovich. A curious accident

happened to me on the road. I've run entirely out of cash. Have you four

hundred rubles to lend me?



ARTEMY. I have.



KHLESTAKOV. That comes in pat. Thank you very much.







SCENE VII





Khlestakov, Bobchinsky, and Dobchinsky.



BOBCHINSKY. I have the honor to present myself--a resident of this town,

Piotr, son of Ivan Bobchinsky.



DOBCHINSKY. I am Piotr, son of Ivan Dobchinsky, a squire.



KHLESTAKOV. Oh, yes, I've met you before. I believe you fell? How's your

nose?



BOBCHINSKY. It's all right. Please don't trouble. It's dried up, dried

up completely.



KHLESTAKOV. That's nice. I'm glad it's dried up. [Suddenly and

abruptly.] Have you any money?



DOBCHINSKY. Money? How's that--money?



KHLESTAKOV. A thousand rubles to lend me.



BOBCHINSKY. Not so much as that, honest to God I haven't. Have you,

Piotr Ivanovich?



DOBCHINSKY. I haven't got it with me, because my money--I beg to inform

you--is deposited in the State Savings Bank.



KHLESTAKOV. Well, if you haven't a thousand, then a hundred.



BOBCHINSKY [fumbling in his pockets]. Have you a hundred rubles, Piotr

Ivanovich? All I have is forty.



DOBCHINSKY [examining his pocket-book]. I have only twenty-five.



BOBCHINSKY. Look harder, Piotr Ivanovich. I know you have a hole in your

pocket, and the money must have dropped down into it somehow.



DOBCHINSKY. No, honestly, there isn't any in the hole either.



KHLESTAKOV. Well, never mind. I merely mentioned the matter. Sixty-five

will do. [Takes the money.]



DOBCHINSKY. May I venture to ask a favor of you concerning a very

delicate matter?



KHLESTAKOV. What is it?



DOBCHINSKY. It's a matter of an extremely delicate nature. My oldest

son--I beg to inform you--was born before I was married.



KHLESTAKOV. Indeed?



DOBCHINSKY. That is, only in a sort of way. He is really my son, just

as if he had been born in wedlock. I made up everything afterwards,

set everything right, as it should be, with the bonds of matrimony,

you know. Now, I venture to inform you, I should like to have him

altogether--that is, I should like him to be altogether my legitimate

son and be called Dobchinsky the same as I.



KHLESTAKOV. That's all right. Let him be called Dobchinsky. That's

possible.



DOBCHINSKY. I shouldn't have troubled you; but it's a pity, he is such

a talented youngster. He gives the greatest promise. He can recite

different poems by heart; and whenever he gets hold of a penknife,

he makes little carriages as skilfully as a conjurer. Here's Piotr

Ivanovich. He knows. Am I not right?



BOBCHINSKY. Yes, the lad is very talented.
