

WIDOW. I have come to complain against the Governor, father.



KHLESTAKOV. What is it? What for? Be brief.



WIDOW. He flogged me, father.



KHLESTAKOV. How so?



WIDOW. By mistake, my father. Our women got into a squabble in the

market, and when the police came, it was all over, and they took me and

reported me--I couldn't sit down for two days.



KHLESTAKOV. But what's to be done now?



WIDOW. There's nothing to be done, of course. But if you please, order

him to pay a fine for the mistake. I can't undo my luck. But the money

would be very useful to me now.



KHLESTAKOV. All right, all right. Go now, go. I'll see to it. [Hands

with petitions are thrust through the window.] Who else is out there?

[Goes to the window.] No, no. I don't want to, I don't want to. [Leaves

the window.] I'm sick of it, the devil take it! Don't let them in, Osip.



OSIP [calling through the window]. Go away, go away! He has no time.

Come tomorrow.



The door opens and a figure appears in a shag cloak, with unshaven

beard, swollen lip, and a bandage over his cheek. Behind him appear a

whole line of others.



OSIP. Go away, go away! What are you crowding in here for?



He puts his hands against the stomach of the first one, and goes out

through the door, pushing him and banging the door behind.







SCENE XII





Khlestakov and Marya Antonovna.



MARYA. Oh!



KHLESTAKOV. What frightened you so, mademoiselle?



MARYA. I wasn't frightened.



KHLESTAKOV [showing off]. Please, miss. It's a great pleasure to me

that you took me for a man who--May I venture to ask you where you were

going?



MARYA. I really wasn't going anywhere.



KHLESTAKOV. But why weren't you going anywhere?



MARYA. I was wondering whether mamma was here.



KHLESTAKOV. No. I'd like to know why you weren't going anywhere.



MARYA. I should have been in your way. You were occupied with important

matters.



KHLESTAKOV [showing off]. Your eyes are better than important matters.

You cannot possibly disturb me. No, indeed, by no means. On the

contrary, you afford me great pleasure.



MARYA. You speak like a man from the capital.



KHLESTAKOV. For such a beautiful lady as you. May I give myself the

pleasure of offering you a chair? But no, you should have, not a chair,

but a throne.



MARYA. I really don't know--I really must go [She sits down.]



KHLESTAKOV. What a beautiful scarf that is.



MARYA. You are making fun of me. You're only ridiculing the provincials.



KHLESTAKOV. Oh, mademoiselle, how I long to be your scarf, so that I

might embrace your lily neck.



MARYA. I haven't the least idea what you are talking

about--scarf!--Peculiar weather today, isn't it?



KHLESTAKOV. Your lips, mademoiselle, are better than any weather.



MARYA. You are just saying that--I should like to ask you--I'd rather

you would write some verses in my album for a souvenir. You must know

very many.



KHLESTAKOV. Anything you desire, mademoiselle. Ask! What verses will you

have?



MARYA. Any at all. Pretty, new verses.



KHLESTAKOV. Oh, what are verses! I know a lot of them.



MARYA. Well, tell me. What verses will you write for me?
