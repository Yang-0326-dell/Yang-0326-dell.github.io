MARYA. Really, mamma, it was to me he said that.



ANNA. Yes, of course--to you, too. I don't deny it.



GOVERNOR. He even frightened us. He said he would put a bullet through

his brains. "I'll shoot myself, I'll shoot myself," he said.



MANY GUESTS. Well, for the Lord's sake!



AMMOS. How remarkable!



LUKA. It must have been fate that so ordained.



ARTEMY. Not fate, my dear friend. Fate is a turkey-hen. It was the

Governor's services that brought him this piece of fortune. [Aside.]

Good luck always does crawl into the mouths of swine like him.



AMMOS. If you like, Anton Antonovich, I'll sell you the dog we were

bargaining about.



GOVERNOR. I don't care about dogs now.



AMMOS. Well, if you don't want it, then we'll agree on some other dog.



KOROBKIN'S WIFE. Oh, Anna Andreyevna, how happy I am over your good

fortune. You can't imagine how happy I am.



KOROBKIN. But where, may I ask, is the distinguished guest now? I heard

he had gone away for some reason or other.



GOVERNOR. Yes, he's gone off for a day on a highly important matter.



ANNA. To his uncle--to ask his blessing.



GOVERNOR. To ask his blessing. But tomorrow--[He sneezes, and all burst

into one exclamation of well-wishes.] Thank you very much. But tomorrow

he'll be back. [He sneezes, and is congratulated again. Above the other

voices are heard those of the following.]



{CAPTAIN. I wish you health, your Honor.



{BOBCHINSKY. A hundred years and a sack of ducats.



{DOBCHINSKY. May God increase it to a thousand.



{ARTEMY. May you go to hell!



{KOROBKIN'S WIFE. The devil take you!



GOVERNOR. I'm very much obliged to you. I wish you the same.



ANNA. We intend to live in St. Petersburg now. I must say, the

atmosphere here is too village-like. I must say, it's extremely

unpleasant. My husband, too--he'll be made a general there.



GOVERNOR. Yes, confound it, gentlemen, I admit I should very much like

to be a general.



LUKA. May God grant that you get a generalship.



RASTAKOVSKY. From man it is impossible, but from God everything is

possible.



AMMOS. High merits, high honors.



ARTEMY. Reward according to service.



AMMOS [aside]. The things he'll do when he becomes a general. A

generalship suits him as a saddle suits a cow. It's a far cry to his

generalship. There are better men than you, and they haven't been made

generals yet.



ARTEMY [aside]. The devil take it--he's aiming for a generalship.

Well, maybe he will become a general after all. He's got the air of

importance, the devil take him! [Addressing the Governor.] Don't forget

us then, Anton Antonovich.



AMMOS. And if anything happens--for instance, some difficulty in our

affairs--don't refuse us your protection.



KOROBKIN. Next year I am going to take my son to the capital to put him

in government service. So do me the kindness to give me your protection.

Be a father to the orphan.



GOVERNOR. I am ready for my part--ready to exert my efforts on your

behalf.



ANNA. Antosha, you are always ready with your promises. In the first

place, you won't have time to think of such things. And how can you--how

is it possible for you, to burden yourself with such promises?



GOVERNOR. Why not, my dear? It's possible occasionally.



ANNA. Of course it's possible. But you can't give protection to every

small potato.



KOROBKIN'S WIFE. Do you hear the way she speaks of us?



GUEST. She's always been that way. I know her. Seat her at table and

she'll put her feet on it.
